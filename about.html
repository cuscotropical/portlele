        <p>My name is Leandro Rodrigues Alexandre, I graduated from law school, I always looked for challenges and I think that made me enter the field of development.
            Since I was young, I've always had a great interest in learning and finding solutions to all the challenges that I had in front of me.
            My passion for technology made me learn a lot but where I found myself or rather where I was found was in the front end, today I can say that I don't see myself farther from a computer or technologies.
